## Module 2 Challenge, 26 June 2023, VBA Challenge

Development has stopped on this project

##Description

This script analyses data from a spreadsheet of annual changes in the stock market.

It creates a table for every stock, showing yearly change (highlighted green for increase, red for decrease), percent change, and total volume.

It creates a separate table that shows which stocks had the greatest % increase, greatest % decrease, and greatest total volume.

These two tables are summarized on each sheet of an excel workbook.

Before:
![before_stock_first_sheet.png(./)]

After:
![after_stock_first_sheet.png(./)]

## Usage

The main macro will populate every sheet in the workbook with these two tables.

DoEverything will populate the current sheet with these two tables.

There is a TestClearColumns that clears all columns I:Q. Be careful with that.
